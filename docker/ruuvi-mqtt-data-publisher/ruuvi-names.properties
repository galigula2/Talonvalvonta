# Optional, additional friendly names for tags (useful when used with Grafana for example)
# Copy this file as "ruuvi-names.properties" to the same directory as the collector application itself.
# The names are applied only to new measurements, this allows you to change the tag names without 
# affecting the names in past measurements, for example if you move a tag to a new place
# format is: MAC=Name of the tag
# Note that these are used as part of MQTT topic names so avoid spaces!
# Examples:
D080B3DA4C82=Makuuhuone
E73A6B8BBE38=Kodinhoito
E47FD79E6D7D=Olkkari
CF30C3DE4DA6=Keittio
